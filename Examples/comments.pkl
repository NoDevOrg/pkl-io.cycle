// About and Annotations
// 
// The About object is an optional object that holds information the developer 
// would like to save, including the version of the stack file and a description.
// 
// The top level annotations object is a key value store that's meant for the developer.
// If a developer wishes to store additional information in this area, they can do so 
// without impacting any other configuration throughout the stack.
